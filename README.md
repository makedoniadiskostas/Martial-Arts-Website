# 🥊 Martial-Arts-Website
I recently built a website for ΑΣ KINEZOS TEAM, a martial arts club, as part of my web development journey.
The goal was to create a platform that highlights the club’s spirit, training programs, and community — while keeping the design clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.
The project is now online and viewable, though still a work in progress. I’ll be improving the design, adding new features, and updating the text and images to better reflect the club.
